ASCII-Scramble, Version 1.03 (26-Dec-94)

==========================================================



COPYRIGHT

ASCII-Scramble is freeware. That means you don't have to pay
anything if you install it on your harddisk and play it all
the day.

You run this program at your own risc. I'm not responsible
for any damage it does to your hardware or software
(Maybe it will start to format your harddisk, if you don't
run it only in an OS/2-dos box ;-) )



INTRODUCTION

Do you like these graphics overloaded, sound-blasting, 20MB
using, colorfull games that have been produced the recent
years? Well, then this game is not for you.



FEATURES

* ASCSCRAM.EXE is not even 40k long!
* uses 3 different color types, depending on the color of
  your dos prompt (standard, invers, highlighted)
* displays only standard ASCII characters (7 bit) on screen
  (exept the "”" of Tommy-Saftw”rx at the title screen)
* absolutely no dull sound support
  (in fact: no sound support at all)
* needs only about 10K of memory at run time
* runs at usable speed even with XTs



HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

None. Should also run with an abacus, if it owns an 80x86

Actually, ASCII-Scramble was developed using an Olivetti M15
(year of construction: 1986; hardware: 8088, CMOS version; 2
floppy devices; 512K ram) and Turbo Pascal 5.5. I also know
how it is to work with a 486-cpu, 16MB ram, 420MB hard disk
and Turbo Pascal 7.0, and I must say: there's nearly no
difference at all... (especiallay if your source code is just 
about 3700 lines long)

The current version works only with a 40x25 color display
(video memory at $b800), so it won't run with a hercules
monochrome adaptor. Version 1.1 will work with any display
and any screen size.



INSTALLATION

Just copy all files of this distribution to your game
directory. Then type "ASCSCRAM" (I really like filenames
containing only 8 characters :-( )



BACKGROUND STORY

In 2156, an alien race attacked to human space empire and
destroyed all human military forces within just a thew days.
There is only one chance left: to attack the enemy's home
planet. So you... Oh god, these stories are so dull.
Let's stop it.



GAME OBJECT

Shoot at everything that obviously scores points!



CONTROLS

Use cursor keys to move your ship, space bar to fire
missiles and bombs, enter to activate extra under extra
cursor. "B" activates a smart bomb, if any available.
Pressing "P" will pause game until "P" is pressed again. ESC
will abort game.



EXTRAS

When you've shot a certain amount of enemies, an extra
symbol ("$") will appear. Pick it up, and the extra cursors
jumps to the next extra. possible extras are:

    SPEED : increses ship speed
    SHOOT : increses reload ratio of ship gun
    BOMB  : adds a smart bomb
            (your ship can carry up to nine smart bombs)
    DOUBLE: increases power of your ship gun
    WING  : adds two wings to your ship, which will also fire
            (better shot)
    SHIELD: makes ship immune to enemy & bullet collision
            for a short time (ship blinks)

After an crash, your speed and shoot level will not be
reseted at all, but only decreased.



ENEMIES:

     T  : fuel storage; Shoot it to tank your ship; 1 shot
          required
     A  : rocket, moving upwards; 1 or 2 shots required

     V  : rocket, moving downwards; 1 or 2 shots required
   
     X  : enemy bullet; indestructable

    O=- : comet; indestructable

     /[
    <O= : ufo; 5 shots required
     \[

    At end of scene 4 and 5, special enemies will await you.

    HINT: Always shoot at the highlighted characters of an
          object!

    NOTE: kill-bill-productions is a sub-label of

          ms-dos compatible stuff.
          Who is Bill? Guess.. ;-)


WHY IS THE AUTHOR SO ANGRY ABOUT MICROSOFT?

Because he knows what an operationg system should be able to
do in 1994. 
So he owns an Amiga (which supports 32bit, preemtive 
multitasking, an autocofig bus since 1985 and easy, but
powerfull video options -> it always makes me smile seeing
these pci-pentiums trying to display a 320x240 video with
15fps under windows)



FUTURE

* for ASCII-Scramble: version 1.1 might support: extremely dull 
  sound support, advanced display support, enemy bullets
  targeting to your ship and more intelligent ufos which don't
  fly into the lanscape any more.
* for microsoft and intel: the future is dated to 1980
* for Amiga: I'm frightened there is no future
  (thanks to microsoft, intel, all users of their hard-
  and software, and of course to commodore for their
  degenerated advertising stuff :-( )
* for me: the future is talingent 
  (go on dreaming, silly guy...)
